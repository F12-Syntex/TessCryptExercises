For the Vigen√®re Cipher decryption with a known key, I implemented a character-by-character decryption approach. The program iterates over each character in the ciphertext and checks if it's a letter. If so, it decrypts the character using the corresponding character from the key (repeated cyclically) by shifting it back by the appropriate amount (modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet). The decrypted character is then stored in the output array. After processing all characters, the program returns the decrypted plaintext as a string.
