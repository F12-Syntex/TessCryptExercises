# Cryptography Assignment: Tess of the d'Urbervilles

This repository contains my solutions for the Cryptography Assignment from the COMP5580 course at the University of Kent. The assignment involves decrypting extracts from the novel "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" by Thomas Hardy, which are encoded using various cryptographic techniques.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment consists of seven exercises, each involving a different cipher or encryption method:

[x] 1. **Exercise 1**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a Caesar cipher.
[x] 2. **Exercise 2**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a Vigenere cipher using the key "TESSOFTHEDURBERVILLES".
[] 3. **Exercise 3**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a Vigenere cipher using an arbitrary 6-letter key.
[] 4. **Exercise 4**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a Vigenere cipher using an arbitrary 4-6 letter key.
[] 5. **Exercise 5**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a transposition cipher written row-wise across 4-6 columns.
[] 6. **Exercise 6**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a transposition cipher written row-wise across 6 columns with an arbitrary column order.
[] 7. **Exercise 7**: Decrypt a plaintext encoded with a general substitution cipher.

## Resources

The assignment provided the following resources:

- `tess.txt`: The complete ASCII text of "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" from Project Gutenberg.
- `tess27.txt`: A reduced version of the text with a 27-character alphabet.
- `tess26.txt`: A further reduced version with a 26-character alphabet.
